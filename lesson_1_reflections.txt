How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Muy fácilmente ya que se puede revisar mejor el código


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	because is better save all the project and not only a file
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log se usa directamente en la linea de comandos
	git diff id-old id-new donde id-old es el commit mas viejo y id-new es el commit mas nuevo


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Cómo podría usar el control de versión para hacer cambios que pueden alterar algo con más confianza?
	Yo creo que con una buena identificación en el comentario de cada commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
